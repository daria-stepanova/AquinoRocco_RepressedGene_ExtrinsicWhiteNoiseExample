# AquinoRocco_RepressedGene_ExtrinsicWhiteNoiseExample
This small code reproduces numerical results of the influence of extrinsic white noise on the degradation rate in the repressed gene system (Eqs 3.1-3.2, Figure 2) from the paper Bimodality in gene expression without feedback: from Gaussian white noise to log-normal coloured noise by Gerardo Aquino and Andrea Rocco (2020).
